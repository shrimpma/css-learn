All of our hair is 100% human and Remy grade, cuticle intact!\nQ2. Are the tapes single sided or double sided? A2. Our tapes are made to be sandwiched together, making them double. They can be used as single if you use single sided tape.\nQ3. Are these reusable with new tape? A3. Yes, the tapes are reusable with re-tab tape when you are in need of a move up.\nQ4. How long the lifespan of the tape? A4. Installation generally lasts 4 weeks, longer depending on how often you wash your hair, how fast your hair grows, etc.\nQ5. Do i have to remove them every-time i wash the hair? A5. Nope! Definitely not! You leave them installed until you feel they need to be removed!\nQ6. How do you apply tape in extensions? Can I do it myself?A6. You'd better to have them professionally installed by a licensed cosmetologist. There are several ways to apply the hair extensions as a stylist.\nQ7. How to care the hair pieces? A7. Because our hair is 100% human hair and the cuticle is intact the care process is pretty painless. To get the maximum use out of the hair we generally recommend you wash your hair twice a week and try not to use products that have a high amount of additives and wax in them. Moroccoil and Amika are the top two brands of products that work really well with our hair! Definitely stay away from heavy oils, a light oil is the best kind to use! Again, the best oil is going to be a Moroccoil or Amika oil. You can use heat and everything as normal, so no worries there!\n\n\n split \nSee Videos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Generally going 2 shades darker is not a problem. Lightening and bleaching are discouraged for it results in damage of the quality of the hair.\nQ4. Can I straighten or curl hair ?A4. Yes. You can style your AmazingBeauty hair extensions freely to blend perfectly with your own hair.Q5. What’s the daily care for Amazing Beauty Hair Extensions?A5. Lightly spritz the hair with conditioner and water mix. Detangle with fingers if necessary.Q6. How often do I wash my Amazing Beauty Hair Extensions?A6. ONLY wash your Amazing Beauty Hair Extensions when they look like they absolutely need it! Don’t wash them as often as your own hair as they don’t receive natural oils and nutrition from scalp.\n\n\n split \nSee Videos \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

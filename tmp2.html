	<h1>Halo hair extensions </h1>
	<p>Halo hair extensions are the fastest and easiest way to transform your hair into fuller, longer looks!</p>
	<p> It has a thin, clear nylon wire that
		goes on the top of your head. In just a couple of minutes you can increase your hair's volume and length to achieve the look that you desire,
		without any of the fuss! The Halo is an excellent option for someone who just wants to try hair extensions before making a full commitment -
		perfect for hair extension beginners. 
		</p>
		<p>
		HALO BENEFITS Versatility: There are no mistakes with this extension option. Adjust the wire to fit
		snugly around the crown of your head, then wear your hair like a headpiece or band. Halo hair can be easily removed and re-positioned during
		the installation process. Easy Installation: Halo hair is also called Solo hair. So you don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s help to install these
		extensions, and anyone can do it! </p><p>Simply pull the wire band over your head, resting it flush around the crown of your head, then pull a layer
		of your natural hair on top. Brush into place. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>No Damage: Solo extensions rest on your head, rather than on the hair itself. That means no
			uncomfortable tugging or tension at the roots. But they won&rsquo;t budge or slip or fall out, either. They&rsquo;ll stay comfortably and
			securely in place, situated as they are between layers of your natural hair. 
			</li>
			<li>
			Cost effective: No regular expensive salon visits needed for
			maintenance unlike other types of extensions. Having your hair &lsquo;moved up&rsquo;, &lsquo;re-bonded&rsquo;, etc etc can cost hundreds of
			dollars per visit.
			<li> Long-Lasting: Halo hair extensions can last up to from a few months up to one year if worn regularly, and even longer if
			only worn occasionally. 
		</li>
		</li>
			<li>Regular maintenance, combined with quality hair care, makes these extensions ideal for a lasting look.</li>

<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><b><span style="font-size: 22px;">Why do so many African-American women wear wigs?</span></b></span></p>
<p>Black women wear wigs for the same reasons WHITE women wear wigs. To change their hairstyle.</p>
<p>First, it's true African- American women like to wear hair wigs,most of black women just want to call it protective styling.</p>
<p>The reason African- American women wear natural wigs is because black hair texture is thick, easy to tangle, and difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>It's also subjective to frequent breakage and damage when it comes in contact with the atmosphere, and therefore requires careful styling.</p>
<p>The use of remi human hair wigs for black women to cover our own hair is done so that we can focus on other aspects of our lives other than our
    hair.</p>

<p>You have a lot of choices in this so it is hard to determine what is good? I don&rsquo;t want to recommend my own brand .com, but more importantly
    I want to leave you with few questions to understand the options.</p>
<p>Front lace vs full lace wigs - Both have natural looking front lines. Check the quality of the front lines and see if that is the look you want.
</p>
<p>1.Full lace and front lace both give you a similar look. Full lace are more breathable and less heated, whereas front lace will have more heat in
    the back. Full lace are more expensive compared to front lace.</p>
<p>2.Hair type choice - Wigs can be built with synthetic, human hair or 100% virgin hair. There are positives and negatives of all choices. It is hard
    to differentiate the hair type, but anyone selling brazillian or peruvian is not telling the truth on the hair quality.</p>
<p>3.Parting - Do you need a fixed parting, free parting wig. Check out the parting to make sure, if that is what you need. Other choices like
    textures, colors are decided based on your fashion preference.</p>
